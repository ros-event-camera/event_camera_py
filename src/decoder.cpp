        Decode event message. After calling decode() the decoded events

        call updates the state of the decoder, so no messages should be skipped.

        Works similar to decode() but is less convenient to use.

        Processes message of encoded events and updates state of the decoder, but

        Peeks into encoded message to find first event sensor time stamp. The
        boolean return flag indicates whether any time stamp was detected.
        This function does not advance the state of the decoder, and will not
        leverage state from previous message packets. It is typically used to cheaply find
        the first time stamp in an EventPacket message without decoding the whole packet.

        This function is useful for sensors that provide absolute time stamps,
        for example libcaer based devices. The time stamps of the decoded events
        starts at zero, but the absolut event time in nanoseconds since begin of the epoch
        can be recovered by adding the start time.

        Fetches decoded change detected (CD) events. Will clear out decoded events, to be

        The returned structured numpy array has fields 'x', 'y', 't', 'p'. Event time is a signed

        Fetches decoded change detected (CD) event packets. Will clear out decoded events, to be
